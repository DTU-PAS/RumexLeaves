<title>RumexLeaves | RumexLeaves contains in total 809 images with 7747 annotations of Rumex obtusifolius leaves. For each leaf, a pixel-wise leaf blade annotation as well as a polyline annotation of the stem - if visible - and vein were manually created. The stem is visible for ~ 45% of the leaves. We differentiate between two variants of datapoints: (1) iNaturalist datapoints that have been downloaded from the plant publisher iNaturalist and (2) RoboRumex datapoints collected with an agriculture robotics platform. Both variants originate from real-world settings.</title>
