## Overview:
RumexLeaves contains in total 809 images with 7747 annotations of Rumex obtusifolius leaves. For each leaf, a pixel-wise leaf blade annotation as well as a polyline annotation of the stem - if visible - and vein were manually created. The stem is visible for ~ 45% of the leaves. We differentiate between two variants of datapoints: (1) iNaturalist datapoints that have been downloaded from the plant publisher iNaturalist and (2) RoboRumex datapoints collected with an agriculture robotics platform. Both variants originate from real-world settings.

## Getting started: Pytorch Dataset Class
Download data
```
wget ToDO
```
Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The Pytorch Datasets allows an easy entrypoint to work with the dataset.
To visualize some example images, please run.
```
python rumex_leaves/visualize_img_data.py --data_folder <path-to-your-extracted-RumexLeaves-folder> --num_images <number-of-images-to-display> --datapoint_type <iNaturalist/RoboRumex>
